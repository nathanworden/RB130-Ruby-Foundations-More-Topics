# In the previous exercise, we wrote a method that emulates Enumerable#each_cons, but limited our method to handling 2 elements at a time. Enumerable#each_cons can actually handle any number of elements at a time: 1, 2, 3, or more.

# Update your each_cons method so it takes an argument that specifies how many elements should be processed at a time.


# Algorithm
# define a method which takes an array and an integer
# Take a slice of the array from array[0] to array[num - 1]

def each_cons(arr, group_size)
  start = 0
  finish = group_size - 1
  num_iterations = arr.size - (finish)
  num_iterations.times do |_|
    set = arr[start..finish]
    yield(*set)
    start += 1
    finish += 1
  end
