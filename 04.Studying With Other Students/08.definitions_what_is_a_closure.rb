# What is a closure?


#Answer:

# A closure is a general programming concept that allows programmers 
# to save a "chunk of code" and execute it at a later time. 
# It's called a "closure" because it's said to bind its surrounding 
# artifacts (ie, variables, methods, objects, etc) and build an
# "enclosure" around everything so that they can be referenced when
# the closure is later executed. It's sometimes useful to think 
# of a closure as a method that you can pass around and execute, 
# but it's not defined with an explicit name
