# What is a closure?

# A clouse meets all three of these definitions:

# It can be passed around like a variable;
# It can be executed on demand later:
# It can refer to variables from the context in which it was created.

# Assertion - 2 important words:

# expected value and actual value

# Assertions compare that the actual value are equal to the expected value.

# The test creates the context in which assertions are run.
