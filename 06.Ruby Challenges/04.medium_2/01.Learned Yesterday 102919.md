Palindrome Products

A Palindrome looks the same forward as it does backward.

Given a range, the program needs to find all the palindrome products. Then be able to pull up the largest, smallest, and the products of those numbers.

`Array#combination`

`combination` Combines each element of the array together. Different orders do not count as new combinations. And elements cannot be paird with themselves.

It is called like this:

`[1, 2, 3].combination(2)`

This will create an enumerator. But you can add `to_a` to the end of it to get an array.
