## Pascal's Triangle

Write a program that computes Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

```terminal
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
# ... etc
```

Test suite:

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'
require_relative 'pascals_triangle'

class TriangleTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_one_row
    triangle = Triangle.new(1)
    assert_equal [[1]], triangle.rows
  end

  def test_two_rows
    skip
    triangle = Triangle.new(2)
    assert_equal [[1], [1, 1]], triangle.rows
  end

  def test_three_rows
    skip
    triangle = Triangle.new(3)
    assert_equal [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1]], triangle.rows
  end

  def test_fourth_row
    skip
    triangle = Triangle.new(4)
    assert_equal [1, 3, 3, 1], triangle.rows.last
  end

  def test_fifth_row
    skip
    triangle = Triangle.new(5)
    assert_equal [1, 4, 6, 4, 1], triangle.rows.last
  end

  def test_twentieth_row
    skip
    triangle = Triangle.new(20)
    expected = [
      1, 19, 171, 969, 3876, 11_628, 27_132, 50_388, 75_582, 92_378, 92_378,
      75_582, 50_388, 27_132, 11_628, 3876, 969, 171, 19, 1
    ]
    assert_equal expected, triangle.rows.last
  end
end
```

###### Method Name:

##### `each_cons(n) {...}`

What do you know about `Array#each_cons()` ?

`each_cons(){...}` Iterates the block `{...}` for each array of consecutive <n> elements from the calling array. If no block is given, returns an enumerator.

`[1, 2, 3, 4].each_cons(2) {|sub_array| p sub_array}`

Will output:

```ruby
[1, 2]
[2, 3]
[3, 4]
```

###### How do you accomplish x with this method?

How to you take this array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]

And sum each consecutive pair together and return a new array?

Your answer should look like this: [3, 5, 7, 9, 6]

Answer:

`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1].each_cons(2).map {|left, right| left + right}`

You could also do this:

```ruby
enum = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1].each_cons(2)
enum.map {|left, right|left + right }
```
